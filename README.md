Task 1:
Used a commonly known atmospheric pressure relation to compute altitudes wrt time.
Due to the inherently messy data, I used a moving average to make sure the graph was smooth and continous for altitudes.
I then further using that data to show the velocity as well.
Task 2:
As I had no previous experience with tinkercad or arduino, most of the work was spent on going through articles, tutorials and other tools to learn the wiring part of it.
Code basically cleans up data into another moving average and changes the led reading based on the intensity of change of reading in the sensor.
